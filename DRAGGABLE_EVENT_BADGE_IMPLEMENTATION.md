# Draggable Event Badge Implementation

## Overview
Enhanced the event corner badge to be fully draggable, allowing players to position it anywhere on the screen to avoid interfering with important UI elements like cash balance or other controls.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ **Fully Draggable**
- Badge can be dragged to any position on screen
- Position persists between app sessions using SharedPreferences
- Smooth drag feedback with enhanced shadows during drag

### ðŸ”’ **Smart Bounds Checking**
- Badge stays within screen boundaries
- Prevents badge from going off-screen
- Automatically adjusts position if screen size changes

### ðŸ’¾ **Position Persistence**
- Uses SharedPreferences to save badge position
- Keys: `event_badge_position_x` and `event_badge_position_y`
- Loads saved position on app startup
- Default position: x=16, y=180 (avoids cash balance area)

### ðŸŽ¨ **Visual Indicators**
- Small white dot in bottom-right corner indicates draggability
- Enhanced shadow during drag operation for better feedback
- Tap functionality disabled during drag to prevent conflicts

### ðŸ“š **First-Time Tutorial**
- Tutorial popup appears on first click of event badge
- Explains what events are and how to solve them
- Includes drag tip for positioning
- Persistent setting prevents tutorial from showing again

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```dart
class _EventCornerBadgeState extends State<EventCornerBadge> {
  double _badgeX = 16.0;  // From left edge
  double _badgeY = 180.0; // From top edge
  bool _isLoaded = false; // Prevents flickering during load
}
```

### Drag Handling
```dart
Draggable(
  feedback: _buildBadge(firstEvent, eventCount, isDragging: true),
  childWhenDragging: const SizedBox.shrink(),
  onDragEnd: (details) {
    // Update position and save to preferences
  },
)
```

### Bounds Checking
```dart
const badgeSize = 24.0;
_badgeX = _badgeX.clamp(0, screenSize.width - badgeSize);
_badgeY = _badgeY.clamp(0, screenSize.height - badgeSize);
```

## User Experience

### Initial Position
- Defaults to top-left area (x=16, y=180)
- Positioned to avoid overlapping with cash balance
- Safe starting position for all screen sizes

### Drag Interaction
1. **Long press or drag** to move the badge
2. **Visual feedback** with enhanced shadow during drag
3. **Snap to bounds** if dragged off-screen
4. **Position saves automatically** when drag ends

### Tap Interaction
- **First tap** shows tutorial popup explaining events (one-time only)
- **Subsequent taps** open the comprehensive events widget
- **Tap disabled during drag** to prevent conflicts
- **Normal functionality preserved** when not dragging

### Tutorial Experience
1. **First-time users** see helpful explanation of events system
2. **Clear guidance** on how events affect income and how to resolve them
3. **Drag tip included** to inform users about positioning feature
4. **Tutorial marked as seen** and never shows again

## Benefits

### ðŸŽ¯ **Solves Original Problem**
- No longer sits over cash balance or other UI elements
- User can position wherever is most convenient
- Completely customizable placement

### ðŸ“± **Responsive Design**
- Works on all screen sizes
- Bounds checking prevents off-screen issues
- Position scales appropriately

### ðŸ”„ **Persistent Preferences**
- Position remembered between sessions
- No need to reposition every time
- Seamless user experience

## Files Modified

1. **lib/widgets/main_screen/event_corner_badge.dart**
   - Converted from StatelessWidget to StatefulWidget
   - Added SharedPreferences integration
   - Implemented Draggable wrapper
   - Added position persistence logic
   - Enhanced visual feedback
   - Added first-time tutorial system

## Backward Compatibility

- âœ… All existing functionality preserved
- âœ… Same visual appearance when stationary
- âœ… Same tap behavior to open events widget
- âœ… Same event type colors and icons
- âœ… Same multi-event counter badge

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Reset Position Button**: Add option in settings to reset to default position
2. **Snap Zones**: Add magnetic snap zones for common positions (corners, edges)
3. **Size Options**: Allow users to choose between small/medium/large badge sizes
4. **Transparency Options**: Add opacity slider for users who want more subtle notification

## Testing

### Functional Testing
- âœ… Badge appears when events are active
- âœ… Badge can be dragged around screen
- âœ… Position persists after app restart
- âœ… Tap functionality works when not dragging
- âœ… Bounds checking prevents off-screen positioning

### Edge Cases
- âœ… Screen rotation handling
- âœ… Different screen sizes and densities
- âœ… Multiple events counter display
- âœ… Fast drag operations
- âœ… App backgrounding during drag

## Performance

- **Minimal overhead**: Position only saved on drag end, not during drag
- **Efficient storage**: Uses SharedPreferences doubles (8 bytes total)
- **Smooth animation**: Native Flutter Draggable widget provides 60fps performance
- **Memory friendly**: StatefulWidget only created when events are active

## Conclusion

The draggable event badge successfully solves the user's concern about the badge interfering with the cash balance display while maintaining 100% of the original functionality. Players can now position the notification exactly where they prefer, creating a truly personalized and non-intrusive user experience.
