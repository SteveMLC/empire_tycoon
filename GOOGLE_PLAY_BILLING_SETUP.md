## ⚙️ Google Play Console Setup

### Step 1: Create In-App Product
1. **Go to Google Play Console** → Your App → **Monetize** → **Products** → **In-app products**

2. **Click "Create product"** and configure:
   ```
   Product ID: premium_purchase
   Name: Premium Subscription
   Description: Unlock premium features including ad removal, bonus platinum, and exclusive avatars
   
   Price: $4.99 USD
   ```

3. **Product Details:**
   - **Status:** Active
   - **Pricing:** Set to $4.99 (or equivalent in other currencies)
   - **Availability:** All countries where your app is distributed

### Step 2: Configure Pricing
1. **Set base price:** $4.99 USD
2. **Auto-convert to other currencies** or manually set specific prices
3. **Save the pricing configuration**

### Step 3: Activate the Product
1. **Review all product details**
2. **Set status to "Active"**
3. **Save changes**

## 🧪 Testing Setup

### Internal Testing (Recommended First)
1. **Go to Release** → **Testing** → **Internal testing**
2. **Upload a signed APK/AAB** with billing integration
3. **Add test users** to the internal testing track
4. **Install the internal test version** to test purchases

### License Testing (Alternative)
1. **Go to Setup** → **License testing**
2. **Add Gmail accounts** of users who will test purchases
3. **Set test response** for each account:
   - `RESPOND_NORMALLY` - Process real transactions (no charge)
   - `PURCHASED` - Always return successful purchase
   - `CANCELED` - Always return purchase canceled

### Test Purchase Flow
1. **Install test version** of your app
2. **Trigger premium purchase** from the profile screen
3. **Complete test purchase** (will show test dialog)
4. **Verify premium features** are activated
5. **Test "Restore Purchases"** functionality

## 🔍 Verification Steps

### Before Publishing:
- [ ] Product `premium_purchase` created in Play Console
- [ ] Product price set to $4.99
- [ ] Product status is "Active"
- [ ] App uploaded to internal testing track
- [ ] Test purchase flow works correctly
- [ ] Premium features activate after purchase
- [ ] Restore purchases works for existing purchases
- [ ] Purchase handles cancellation gracefully
- [ ] Purchase handles errors properly

### App Behavior Verification:
- [ ] Premium purchase button shows correct localized price
- [ ] Loading states display during purchase
- [ ] Success/error messages appear appropriately  
- [ ] Premium features unlock immediately after purchase
- [ ] Premium status persists after app restart
- [ ] Users who purchased premium on other devices can restore

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Security Considerations:
- **Server-side verification** is recommended for production
- Current implementation uses **client-side verification only**
- Consider implementing **receipt validation** on your backend
- **Monitor for purchase fraud** in Play Console

### Product ID Configuration:
```dart
// Current product ID in BillingService
static const String premiumProductId = 'premium_purchase';
```

### Error Handling:
The implementation handles these scenarios:
- Store not available
- Product not found
- Purchase canceled by user
- Network errors
- Billing service unavailable
- Already purchased (prevents duplicate purchases)

## 📱 User Experience

### Purchase Flow:
1. **User taps "Get Premium"** → Shows purchase dialog with features
2. **User taps "Purchase $4.99"** → Opens Google Play billing
3. **User completes purchase** → Google Play processes payment
4. **App receives confirmation** → Activates premium features immediately
5. **User sees success notification** → Premium badge appears

### Restore Flow:
1. **User taps "Restore Purchases"** → Shows loading dialog
2. **App queries Google Play** → Checks purchase history
3. **If premium found** → Activates premium features
4. **User sees confirmation** → Premium status restored

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **"Product not available"** → Check product ID matches exactly
- **"Billing unavailable"** → Ensure BILLING permission is added
- **"Purchase failed"** → Check device has Google Play Services
- **Test purchases not working** → Verify license testing setup

### Debug Logs:
The billing service provides detailed logging:
```

```
