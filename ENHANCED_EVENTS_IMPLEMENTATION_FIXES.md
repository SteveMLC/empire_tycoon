# Enhanced Events Implementation - Compilation Fixes

## Issue Identification & Resolution

### ðŸš¨ Critical Error Fixed
**Error**: `Colors.red.shade100` used in `const TextStyle` causing compilation failure
**Location**: `lib/widgets/event_notification.dart:165`
**Root Cause**: Flutter's `MaterialColor.shade100` is not a compile-time constant

### âœ… Solution Applied
**Fix**: Removed `const` keyword from `TextStyle` containing dynamic color
**Change**: `const TextStyle(...)` â†’ `TextStyle(...)`
**Impact**: Zero functional change, only compilation fix

```diff
- style: const TextStyle(
+ style: TextStyle(
    fontSize: 11,
    color: Colors.red.shade100,  // This works now
    fontWeight: FontWeight.w400,
  ),
```
