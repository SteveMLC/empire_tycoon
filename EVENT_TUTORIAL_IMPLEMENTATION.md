# Event Tutorial Implementation

## Overview
Added a first-time tutorial popup that appears when a player clicks on the event notification badge for the first time. This helps new players understand the events system and learn about the draggable badge feature.

## Tutorial Content

### Main Message
The tutorial uses simple, clear language to explain:

1. **What events are**: "This alert indicates events happening in your Empire."
2. **Impact**: "Events cause you to lose money."
3. **How to resolve**: "Complete challenges to fix them or wait 60 minutes for auto-expiry."
4. **Bonus tip**: "Drag the alert button to place it where you'd like!"

### Visual Design
- **Modern AlertDialog** with rounded corners
- **Warning icon** (amber color) in the title
- **Clear typography** with proper spacing and line height
- **Lightbulb icon** for the tip section
- **Blue accent colors** for tip text
- **Styled button** with "Got it!" action

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```dart
static const String _tutorialShownKey = 'event_tutorial_shown';
bool _tutorialShown = false;
```

### Flow Control
```dart
void _handleBadgeTap(BuildContext context) {
  if (!_tutorialShown) {
    _showEventTutorial(context);
  } else {
    _openEventsWidget(context);
  }
}
```

### Persistence
- Uses SharedPreferences to track tutorial state
- Key: `event_tutorial_shown` (boolean)
- Loads on widget initialization
- Saves when tutorial is completed

### Dialog Properties
- **Non-dismissible**: `barrierDismissible: false`
- **Rounded corners**: 16px border radius
- **Responsive content**: Column with mainAxisSize.min
- **Clear action**: Single "Got it!" button

## User Experience Flow

### First-Time User
1. **Event occurs** â†’ Badge appears
2. **User taps badge** â†’ Tutorial popup shows
3. **User reads tutorial** â†’ Learns about events and dragging
4. **User clicks "Got it!"** â†’ Tutorial closes, events widget opens
5. **Tutorial marked as seen** â†’ Won't show again

### Returning User
1. **Event occurs** â†’ Badge appears
2. **User taps badge** â†’ Events widget opens directly
3. **No tutorial interruption** â†’ Seamless experience

## Tutorial Text Breakdown

### Core Explanation (3 simple sentences)
```
"This alert indicates events happening in your Empire.
Events cause you to lose money.
Complete challenges to fix them or wait 60 minutes for auto-expiry."
```

### Bonus Feature Tip

## Testing Scenarios

### First-Time Flow
- âœ… Tutorial shows on first badge tap
- âœ… Tutorial explains events clearly
- âœ… Drag tip is included
- âœ… Tutorial transitions to events widget
- âœ… Tutorial marked as seen

### Returning User Flow
- âœ… No tutorial on subsequent taps
- âœ… Direct access to events widget
- âœ… Persistent setting maintained
- âœ… Normal functionality preserved

### Edge Cases
- âœ… App restart preserves tutorial state
- âœ… Multiple events don't affect tutorial
- âœ… Drag functionality still works
- âœ… Tutorial state survives app updates

## Performance Impact

### Minimal Overhead
- **Storage**: 1 boolean in SharedPreferences (1 byte)
- **Memory**: Single boolean in widget state
- **CPU**: One-time check per tap
- **Network**: None

### Efficient Implementation
- Tutorial only loads when needed
- SharedPreferences access is async and cached
- No impact on badge rendering or drag performance

## Code Quality

### Best Practices
- âœ… Proper state management
- âœ… Clean separation of concerns
- âœ… Error handling for SharedPreferences
- âœ… Accessible UI components
- âœ… Consistent code style

### Maintainability
