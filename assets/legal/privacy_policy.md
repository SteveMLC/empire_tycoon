# Privacy Policy for Empire Tycoon

**Effective Date:** April 16 2025

Thank you for playing Empire Tycoon! This Privacy Policy explains how Go7 Studio ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with your use of the Empire Tycoon mobile application (the "App").

We are committed to protecting your privacy. This App is designed to be played without collecting your personal information.

## Information We Collect

We **do not** directly collect Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as your name, or email address through the App.

However, the App integrates with third-party services, such as Google AdMob, for the purpose of displaying advertisements. These services may collect and use certain information, including:

*   **Advertising ID:** A unique, user-resettable ID for advertising, provided by Google Play services.
*   **Device Information:** Such as device model, operating system version, IP address, and mobile network information, which may be used by ad networks for displaying relevant ads and for their own analytics.
*   **Ad Interaction Data:** Information about how you interact with ads shown in the App (e.g., clicks on ads).

The App also utilizes the following functionalities which may involve device features or local storage:

*   **Local Data Storage (`shared_preferences`, `path_provider`):** The App saves your game progress, settings, and preferences directly on your device. This information is stored locally and is not transmitted to us or any third party.
*   **Audio (`audioplayers`):** The App plays sound effects and music using your device's audio capabilities. No audio is recorded or transmitted.
*   **Vibration (`flutter_vibrate`):** The App may use your device's vibration function for haptic feedback during gameplay. This does not involve collecting or transmitting any data.

## How We Use Information

Information stored locally on your device is used solely to:

*   Save and restore your game progress.
*   Remember your in-game settings and preferences.
*   Provide core gameplay features and feedback (like sound and vibration).

Information collected by third-party advertising services, such as Google AdMob, is used to:

*   Serve personalized and non-personalized advertisements within the App.
*   Measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.
*   Prevent fraud and ensure ad security.

## Information Sharing

We **do not** share your locally stored game data with third parties.

However, information collected by third-party advertising services, such as the Advertising ID and related device or ad interaction data, may be shared by these services with their partners to facilitate ad delivery and measurement. We recommend you review the privacy policies of our advertising partners. For Google AdMob, you can find more information here: [https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads)

## Data Security

We take reasonable steps to protect the information stored locally on your device. However, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.

## Children's Privacy

This App is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If you believe we may have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so we can promptly remove it.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on our website. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
