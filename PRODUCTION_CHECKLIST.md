# AdMob Production Deployment Checklist

## Critical Issues to Fix Before Production Release

### 1. ✅ Test Device Configuration (RESOLVED)
- **Issue:** Test device IDs hardcoded - Need to configure properly
- **Status:** Fixed - Added proper test device configuration in `AdMobService.initialize()`
- **Location:** `lib/services/admob_service.dart` lines 30-34

### 2. ⚠️ Production Ad Unit IDs (TODO)
- **Issue:** Still using placeholder production ad unit IDs
- **Status:** NEEDS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION
- **Action Required:** 
  1. Create ad units in AdMob console
  2. Replace placeholder IDs in `lib/services/admob_service.dart` lines 22-25
  3. Update App ID in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

### 3. ✅ Connection Warnings (IMPROVED)
- **Issue:** `W/ConnectionStatusConfig: Dynamic lookup for intent failed`
- **Status:** Improved - Added retry logic for network failures
- **Enhancement:** Added 30-second retry for network errors (codes 2 & 3)

### 4. ✅ Error Tracking (ADDED)
- **Issue:** Limited error visibility for production debugging
- **Status:** Added comprehensive error tracking and performance monitoring
- **Features Added:**
  - Error logging with timestamps
  - Performance metrics (success rate, total ads shown)
  - Session tracking
  - Enhanced debug status reports

### 5. ✅ Ad Performance Monitoring (ADDED)
- **Status:** Added complete performance tracking system
- **Metrics Tracked:**
  - Total ads shown per session
  - Ad failure count and success rate
  - Session duration
  - Individual ad type performance
  - Last error with timestamp

## Pre-Production Testing

### Test Scenarios:
- [ ] Test all 4 ad types load successfully
- [ ] Test ad failure scenarios (airplane mode, poor connection)
- [ ] Test premium user ad bypass functionality
- [ ] Verify performance metrics are working
- [ ] Test error recovery and retry logic

### Performance Monitoring:
- [ ] Monitor ad success rate (should be >85%)
- [ ] Check average ad load times
- [ ] Verify no memory leaks during ad lifecycle
- [ ] Test with multiple ad views per session

## Post-Release Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Watch:
1. **Ad Success Rate** - Target: >90%
2. **Ad Load Time** - Target: <3 seconds
3. **Revenue Per User** - Track monetization effectiveness
4. **Error Rate** - Target: <5%

### Debugging Commands:
```dart
// In debug mode, call these methods:
AdMobService.instance.printDebugStatus();
final report = AdMobService.instance.getPerformanceReport();
print('Performance: $report');
```

## Status Summary:
- ✅ **Code Improvements:** Complete
- ⚠️ **Ad Unit Setup:** REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ACTION
- ✅ **Error Handling:** Enhanced
- ✅ **Performance Tracking:** Added
- ✅ **Debug Tools:** Enhanced

## Next Steps:
1. **IMMEDIATE:** Set up AdMob ad units and replace placeholder IDs
2. **TEST:** Run complete ad testing suite
3. **MONITOR:** Deploy with enhanced logging and monitor performance
4. **OPTIMIZE:** Adjust based on real-world performance data
