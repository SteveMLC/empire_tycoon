# Empire Tycoon Refactoring Notes

## Game State Architecture Refactoring

### Refactoring Income Calculation Components

#### Summary of Changes

1. **Created a Dedicated IncomeService**
   - Moved income calculation logic from `IncomeCalculator` class to a new `IncomeService` class
   - Made `IncomeService` extend `ChangeNotifier` to allow for future reactive updates
   - Added the service to the application's provider tree for consistent dependency injection

2. **Standardized Dependency Injection**
   - Replaced direct function passing with Provider-based dependency injection
   - Updated `TopPanel` to access `IncomeService` through Provider
   - Removed unnecessary local references in `_MainScreenState`

3. **Improved Memory Management**
   - Enhanced safeguards against memory leaks in event listeners
   - Added proper cleanup of listeners when widgets are disposed
   - Added additional checks to ensure listeners are only added when widgets are mounted

4. **Consistent Access Patterns**
   - Standardized how components access shared services
   - Removed direct instance creation in favor of Provider-based access
   - Ensured all components follow the same pattern for accessing game state and services

#### Files Modified

1. **Created New Files:**
   - `services/income_service.dart` - New service for income calculations

2. **Modified Files:**
   - `main.dart` - Added IncomeService to the provider tree
   - `screens/main_screen.dart` - Updated to use Provider-based dependency injection
   - `widgets/main_screen/top_panel.dart` - Updated to access IncomeService through Provider

3. **Deprecated Files:**
   - `widgets/main_screen/income_calculator.dart` - Functionality moved to IncomeService

#### Benefits

1. **Improved Testability**
   - Services can now be easily mocked for unit testing
   - Components have clear dependencies that can be injected

2. **Reduced Memory Leaks**
   - Proper cleanup of listeners when widgets are disposed
   - Safer handling of widget lifecycle events

3. **Consistent Architecture**
   - All components now follow the same pattern for accessing shared state and services
   - Reduced code duplication and improved maintainability

4. **Better Performance**
   - More efficient rebuilds due to proper Provider usage
   - Reduced unnecessary calculations through better caching

#### Next Steps

1. **Remove Legacy IncomeCalculator**
   - Once testing confirms the new IncomeService works correctly, remove the old IncomeCalculator class

2. **Apply Similar Pattern to Other Components**
   - Identify other areas where dependency injection could be improved
   - Standardize service access patterns throughout the application

3. **Add Unit Tests**
   - Create unit tests for the new IncomeService
   - Test different game state scenarios to ensure calculations are correct
