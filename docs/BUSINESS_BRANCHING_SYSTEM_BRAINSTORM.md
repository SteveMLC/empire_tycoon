# Business Branching Upgrade Path System - Brainstorming Document

**Date**: December 2024  
**Status**: Concept/Planning Phase  
**Priority**: High Impact Feature

## Executive Summary

This document captures comprehensive brainstorming for implementing branching upgrade paths in the Empire Tycoon business system. The core concept involves transforming the current linear 10-level upgrade system into a branching system where businesses can specialize into different paths at certain levels, adding strategic depth and replayability.

## Current System Analysis

### Existing Architecture
- **Business Structure**: Simple linear progression (Level 0-10)
- **Upgrade Model**: Single path with fixed levels
- **Data Structure**: `List<BusinessLevel> levels` with cost, income, description, timer
- **UI Pattern**: Single upgrade button with linear progression display
- **Mechanics**: Purchase → Timer → Level increment → Repeat

### System Strengths
- Simple and intuitive
- Well-established upgrade timers and notifications
- Solid business logic foundation
- Working serialization system

### Limitations Addressed
- No meaningful choices after initial purchase
- Limited replayability
- All businesses feel mechanically similar
- No strategic empire building depth

## Core Concept: Branching Upgrade Paths

### Primary Example: Pop-Up Food Stall
**Base Business**: Pop-Up Food Stall (Level 1-2: Basic operations)

**Branch Selection Point**: Level 3

**Three Specialization Paths**:

1. **Taco Stand Path**
   - **Theme**: Mexican street food specialization
   - **Characteristics**: Fast service, high volume, lower margins
   - **Growth Pattern**: Linear steady progression
   - **Visual Evolution**: Cart → Stand → Truck → Multiple locations

2. **Burger Truck Path** 
   - **Theme**: American comfort food mobile operations
   - **Characteristics**: Mobile service, event catering, premium ingredients
   - **Growth Pattern**: Exponential scaling with equipment
   - **Visual Evolution**: Basic truck → Premium truck → Fleet → Franchise

3. **Smoke BBQ Path**
   - **Theme**: Artisanal slow-cooked speciality
   - **Characteristics**: High margins, longer prep times, premium positioning
   - **Growth Pattern**: High-value plateaus with breakthrough moments
   - **Visual Evolution**: Pit → Restaurant → Competition circuit → BBQ empire

## Technical Architecture

### Data Structure Evolution

#### New Core Classes
```dart
class BusinessBranch {
  String id;                    // "taco_stand", "burger_truck", "smoke_bbq"
  String name;                  // "Taco Stand Specialization"
  String description;           // Branch-specific description
  IconData icon;                // Unique icon for this branch
  List<BusinessLevel> levels;   // 10 levels per branch
  BusinessBranchType type;      // Categorization enum
  Map<String, dynamic> metadata; // Branch-specific properties
  
  // Branch-specific characteristics
  double speedMultiplier;       // Upgrade timer modifier
  double incomeMultiplier;      // Base income modifier
  double costMultiplier;        // Upgrade cost modifier
}

enum BusinessBranchType {
  speed,      // Fast service, high volume
  premium,    // High quality, high margins
  innovation, // Unique mechanics
  scaling     // Network effects, exponential growth
}

class Business {
  // ... existing fields ...
  List<BusinessBranch> branches;     // Available upgrade paths
  String? selectedBranchId;          // Current chosen path (null = no choice made)
  int branchSelectionLevel;          // Level at which branching occurs (default: 3)
  bool hasMadeBranchChoice;          // Whether player has selected a path
  DateTime? branchSelectionTime;     // When choice was made (analytics)
}
```

#### Modified Business Logic Methods
```dart
// New methods needed:
bool canSelectBranch()             // Check if player can choose a branch
List<BusinessBranch> getAvailableBranches()  // Get selectable branches
bool selectBranch(String branchId) // Make branch selection
BusinessBranch? getCurrentBranch() // Get active branch
double getBranchMultipliedIncome() // Income calculation with branch modifiers
```

## Game Balance Integration

### Economic Balance Framework

#### Material Pricing Strategy
- **Base Price Scaling**: Each tier uses materials 2-3x more expensive
- **Quantity Scaling**: Higher tiers require exponentially more materials
- **Market Dynamics**: Prices fluctuate ±20% based on demand/supply
- **Bulk Discounts**: 5% discount for 50+ units, 10% for 100+ units

#### Income Scaling Integration
- **Construction Income Ratio**: Construction income = 60% of equivalent traditional business level
- **ROI Timeline**: Buildings should pay for themselves within 4-6 hours of generation
- **Portfolio Effect**: Diminishing returns after 10+ buildings of same type

#### Progression Pacing
- **Tier 1**: Entry level, 1-2 buildings to learn system
- **Tier 2**: Scaling phase, requires 2-3 Tier 1 buildings
- **Tier 3**: Commitment phase, significant investment required
- **Tier 4**: Mastery phase, massive projects with long timelines
- **Tier 5**: Prestige phase, ultimate achievement buildings

### Material Market Simulation

#### Price Fluctuation System
```dart
class MaterialMarket {
  // Market factors affecting prices
  double globalDemand;        // Overall market demand (0.5 - 2.0)
  double playerImpact;        // Player's purchasing impact
  Map<String, double> materialDemand; // Per-material demand
  
  // Price calculation
  double calculatePrice(String materialId) {
    double basePrice = materials[materialId].basePrice;
    double demandMultiplier = materialDemand[materialId] ?? 1.0;
    double globalMultiplier = globalDemand;
    double playerMultiplier = calculatePlayerImpact(materialId);
    
    return basePrice * demandMultiplier * globalMultiplier * playerMultiplier;
  }
  
  // Market events
  void triggerMarketEvent(MarketEvent event); // Price shocks, sales, etc.
  void updateMarketCycle();                   // Daily/weekly cycles
}

enum MarketEvent {
  materialShortage,    // Prices spike
  oversupply,         // Prices drop
  seasonalDemand,     // Cyclical changes
  economicBoom,       // All prices increase
  recession           // All prices decrease
}
```

  Map<BuildingTier, double> tierDemand; // Demand by building tier
  
  // Valuation calculation
  double calculateMarketValue(CompletedBuilding building) {
    double baseValue = building.totalConstructionCost;
    double appreciationRate = calculateAppreciation(building);
    double marketMultiplier = marketHealth;
    double tierMultiplier = tierDemand[building.tier] ?? 1.0;
    double ageMultiplier = calculateAgeEffect(building.completionDate);
    
    return baseValue * appreciationRate * marketMultiplier * 
           tierMultiplier * ageMultiplier;
  }
  
  // Market dynamics
  void processSale(CompletedBuilding building, double salePrice);
  void updateMarketConditions();
  List<MarketTrend> getMarketTrends();
}
```
