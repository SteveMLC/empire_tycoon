# AdMob Multi-Video Ad Reward Timing Fix

**Date:** January 2025  
**Issue:** Rewards granted too early during multi-video ad sequences  
**Status:** üü¢ FIXED

## Problem Description

### The Issue
During double-video ad sequences (e.g., 2x 60-second videos = 120 seconds total), Google AdMob was calling the `onUserEarnedReward` callback after the **first** video completed, even though there was still a second video to watch.

### User Experience Impact
- User starts hustle boost ad
- **First video completes** (60 seconds) ‚Üí Reward granted ‚Üí Boost timer starts
- **Second video still playing** (another 60 seconds)  
- By the time the second video ends, the 60-second boost has **already expired**
- User heard boost activation sound after first video but boost was gone before ad completed

### Evidence from Console Logs
```
üîä Attempting to play sound: assets/sounds/feedback/notification.mp3
üîä Recovering audio system after interruption (ad/etc)...
‚úÖ Audio system healthy after app resume
üîÑ App lifecycle state changed: AppLifecycleState.resumed
```

This showed the boost sound played (first video end) followed by audio recovery (full ad dismissal).

## Root Cause Analysis

### AdMob Callback Timing Issue
Google AdMob has inconsistent behavior with multi-video ads:
- **`onUserEarnedReward`**: Called after each video segment completes
- **`onAdDismissedFullScreenContent`**: Only called after ALL videos complete

### Original Flawed Flow
```dart
await _hustleBoostAd!.show(onUserEarnedReward: (AdWithoutView ad, RewardItem reward) {
  // ‚ùå This fires after FIRST video in multi-video ads
  onRewardEarned('HustleBoost'); // Boost starts immediately
});
```

## Solution: Delayed Reward System

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Store** reward info when `onUserEarnedReward` fires (don't grant yet)
2. **Delay** actual reward granting until `onAdDismissedFullScreenContent` fires
3. **Ensure** rewards are only given after ALL ad content is completely finished

### New Flow
```dart
// Step 1: Store reward info but don't grant yet
await _hustleBoostAd!.show(onUserEarnedReward: (AdWithoutView ad, RewardItem reward) {
  _hustleBoostRewardEarned = true;
  _pendingHustleBoostCallback = onRewardEarned; // Store callback
});

// Step 2: Grant reward only when fully dismissed
onAdDismissedFullScreenContent: (RewardedAd ad) {
  if (_hustleBoostRewardEarned && _pendingHustleBoostCallback != null) {
    _pendingHustleBoostCallback!('HustleBoost'); // Grant reward now
  }
}
```

## Code Changes Made

### 1. Added Delayed Reward State Variables
```dart
// DELAYED REWARD SYSTEM: Prevent early reward granting during multi-video ads
bool _hustleBoostRewardEarned = false;
bool _buildSkipRewardEarned = false;
bool _eventClearRewardEarned = false;
bool _offlineincome2xRewardEarned = false;
Function(String)? _pendingHustleBoostCallback;
Function(String)? _pendingBuildSkipCallback;
Function(String)? _pendingEventClearCallback;
Function(String)? _pendingOfflineincome2xCallback;
```

### 2. Modified All Ad Show Methods
Applied delayed reward pattern to all 4 ad types:
- `showHustleBoostAd()` 
- `showBuildSkipAd()`
- `showEventClearAd()`
- `showOfflineincome2xAd()`

### 3. Enhanced Debug Logging
```dart
onUserEarnedReward: (AdWithoutView ad, RewardItem reward) {
  if (kDebugMode) print('üéÅ User earned HustleBoost reward: ${reward.amount} ${reward.type} - DELAYING until ad fully completes');
  _hustleBoostRewardEarned = true;
  _pendingHustleBoostCallback = onRewardEarned;
}

onAdDismissedFullScreenContent: (RewardedAd ad) {
  if (_hustleBoostRewardEarned && _pendingHustleBoostCallback != null) {
    if (kDebugMode) print('üéÅ Granting delayed HustleBoost reward after full ad completion');
    _pendingHustleBoostCallback!('HustleBoost');
  }
}
```

### 4. State Cleanup
Added proper cleanup in all error cases and disposal:
- Reset flags when ads fail to show
- Clear callbacks when service is disposed
- Reset state at start of each ad session

## Benefits

### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues
- **No more early rewards** during multi-video ads
- **Boost timers start at correct time** (after full ad completion)
- **Consistent behavior** across all ad types
- **Better user experience** - rewards match expectations

### ‚úÖ Maintained Functionality  
- **Single-video ads** work exactly as before
- **Premium users** still bypass ads correctly
- **Error handling** preserved and enhanced
- **Audio recovery** still functions properly

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Debugging
- Clear log messages indicate when delays are happening
- Debug logs show reward timing for troubleshooting
- Warnings when ads are dismissed without earning rewards

## Testing Instructions

### Multi-Video Ad Testing
1. Trigger hustle boost ad
2. **Observe**: First video completes ‚Üí No boost sound/activation
3. **Observe**: Second video completes ‚Üí Boost sound/activation occurs  
4. **Verify**: 60-second boost timer starts after ALL videos finish

### Single-Video Ad Testing  
1. Test with single-video ads
2. **Verify**: Reward granted immediately after ad completes (no noticeable delay)
3. **Confirm**: Existing behavior preserved

### Debug Console Monitoring
Look for these new log messages:
```
üéÅ User earned HustleBoost reward: 1 coins - DELAYING until ad fully completes
üéÅ Granting delayed HustleBoost reward after full ad completion
```

## Files Modified

- **`lib/services/admob_service.dart`**: Core delayed reward system implementation
- **`docs/ADMOB_MULTI_VIDEO_AD_FIX.md`**: This documentation

## Technical Notes

### AdMob Behavior Variation
- **Single-video ads**: `onUserEarnedReward` and `onAdDismissedFullScreenContent` fire nearly simultaneously
- **Multi-video ads**: `onUserEarnedReward` fires between videos, `onAdDismissedFullScreenContent` fires after all complete
- **Our solution**: Works correctly for both scenarios

### Performance Impact
- **Minimal overhead**: Only adds boolean flags and function references
- **No timing dependencies**: Uses AdMob's own callbacks for precision
- **Memory safe**: Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks

### Future-Proofing
- **Scalable pattern**: Easy to apply to new ad types
- **AdMob updates**: Should remain compatible with future AdMob versions
- **Debug ready**: Enhanced logging helps diagnose any future issues

## Status: Production Ready ‚úÖ

This fix resolves the multi-video ad timing issue while maintaining all existing functionality. The delayed reward system ensures users receive their rewards at the correct time regardless of ad format complexity.
