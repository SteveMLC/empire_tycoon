# Widget Lifecycle Fix for Premium Restore

## Issue Description

**Problem:** Premium restore was successfully verifying and restoring premium features, but the UI was freezing on the "processing" dialog due to widget lifecycle violations.

**Error:** `Looking up a deactivated widget's ancestor is unsafe`

**Root Cause:** The async callback function was trying to access `Navigator.of(context)` and `ScaffoldMessenger.of(context)` after the widget context became invalid.

## Technical Details

**Error Location:**
- File: `lib/screens/user_profile_screen.dart`
- Line: 2445 (Navigator.of(context) call)
- Stack trace showed the error occurred in the success callback of the billing service

**Sequence of Events:**
1. User clicks "Check & Restore" button
2. Dialog shows "Checking premium ownership..."
3. Premium verification succeeds (logs show: "üü¢ Premium restored successful")
4. Callback tries to update UI but widget context is invalid
5. App crashes with widget lifecycle error

## Solution Applied

### 1. Converted Callback Pattern to Async/Await
**Root Cause Fix:** The primary issue was that async callbacks were executing after the widget context became invalid. The solution was to eliminate the callback pattern entirely.

**Before (Callback Pattern):**
```dart
await gameService.restorePremiumForVerifiedOwner(
  onComplete: (bool success, String? error) {
    // Widget context could be invalid by the time this executes
    Navigator.of(context).pop(); // ‚ùå CRASHES
  }
);
```

**After (Synchronous Pattern):**
```dart
bool success = await gameService.restorePremiumForVerifiedOwner();
// All UI operations happen in the same context
if (mounted && Navigator.canPop(context)) {
  Navigator.of(context).pop(); // ‚úÖ SAFE
}
```

### 2. Updated Service Layer Architecture
**BillingService Changes:**
- Added `Future<bool> restorePremiumForVerifiedOwner()` (returns boolean)
- Added `_checkAndroidPurchaseHistorySync()` and `_checkiOSPurchaseHistorySync()` 
- Maintained backward compatibility with legacy callback methods

**GameService Changes:**
- Updated to return `Future<bool>` instead of using callbacks
- Simplified interface eliminates callback complexity

### 3. Context-Safe UI Operations
```dart
// Check widget state before all UI operations
if (mounted && Navigator.canPop(context)) {
  Navigator.of(context).pop();
}

// Protected snackbar messages
if (mounted) {
  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(/* message */);
}
```

### 4. Improved Error Handling
```dart
try {
  bool success = await gameService.restorePremiumForVerifiedOwner();
  // Handle success/failure in same context
} catch (e) {
  // Handle errors without context violations
}
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Eliminated Callback Hell**: Converted async callback pattern to clean async/await
2. **Context Safety**: All UI operations happen in the original widget context
3. **Architectural Improvement**: Service layer returns simple boolean instead of using callbacks
4. **Better Error Handling**: Errors are handled in the same context where they occur
5. **User Experience**: Premium restore now completes successfully without UI freezing
6. **Maintainability**: Simpler code flow is easier to understand and debug

## Testing Results

- ‚úÖ Premium restore functionality works correctly
- ‚úÖ No more widget lifecycle errors
- ‚úÖ UI updates properly after async operations
- ‚úÖ Loading dialog closes appropriately
- ‚úÖ Success/error messages display correctly

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Always check `mounted`** before UI operations in async callbacks
2. **Use `Navigator.canPop()`** before calling `Navigator.pop()`
3. **Wrap async UI operations** in try-catch blocks
4. **Test widget disposal scenarios** during async operations
5. **Use `WillPopScope`** for critical dialogs that shouldn't be dismissed accidentally

## Files Modified

- `lib/screens/user_profile_screen.dart` - Converted callback pattern to async/await, added context safety
- `lib/services/billing_service.dart` - Added synchronous restore methods, maintained callback compatibility  
- `lib/services/game_service.dart` - Updated interface to return boolean instead of using callbacks

## Additional Improvements (v2)

### **Timeout Protection System**
Added comprehensive timeout protection to prevent permanent stuck dialogs:

```dart
// 15-second timeout timer prevents permanent freeze
Timer? timeoutTimer = Timer(const Duration(seconds: 15), () {
  if (!dialogClosed && mounted) {
    // Force close dialog and show timeout message
  }
});
```

### **Enhanced Error Handling**
Implemented multiple layers of error protection:
- **Widget mounted checks** before all context operations
- **Try-catch blocks** around Navigator and ScaffoldMessenger calls  
- **Graceful recovery** if dialog operations fail
- **Detailed error logging** for troubleshooting

### **Reduced Async Delays**
Optimized billing service timing to minimize context invalidation risk:
```dart
// Before: 5 seconds (high risk of context invalidation)
await Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 5));

// After: 500ms (much safer)
await Future.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 500));
```

### **Dedicated Premium Restore Handler**
Created `_handlePremiumRestore()` method with comprehensive error management:
- Separate method isolates restore logic
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier testing and maintenance
- Centralized error handling

## Testing Results (Updated)

- ‚úÖ Premium restore functionality works correctly
- ‚úÖ No more widget lifecycle errors  
- ‚úÖ UI updates properly after async operations
- ‚úÖ Loading dialog closes appropriately
- ‚úÖ Success/error messages display correctly
- ‚úÖ **NEW**: Timeout protection prevents permanent freeze
- ‚úÖ **NEW**: Enhanced error handling improves stability
- ‚úÖ **NEW**: Faster async operations reduce failure risk

## Related Issues

This comprehensive fix resolves the premium restore freezing issue while maintaining all existing functionality. The timeout protection system ensures users can never get permanently stuck in the loading dialog, and the enhanced error handling provides a robust user experience even when edge cases occur.
