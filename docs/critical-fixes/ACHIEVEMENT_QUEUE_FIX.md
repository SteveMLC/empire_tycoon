# Achievement Queue System Fix

## Problem
When multiple achievements were earned simultaneously, only the first achievement displayed properly while subsequent achievements would instantly disappear, preventing players from fully experiencing their rewards.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by **conflicting notification systems**:

1. **NotificationLogic** extension (`notification_logic.dart`)
   - Had `_showNextAchievementNotification()` method
   - Included proper auto-dismiss timer with animation delays

2. **AchievementLogic** extension (`achievement_logic.dart`) 
   - Had `_showNextPendingAchievement()` method
   - **Missing proper timing and animation coordination**

3. **AchievementNotification widget**
   - Had its own 4-second auto-dismiss timer
   - **Conflicted with GameState's 6-second timer**

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Consolidated Queue Management
- **Removed** `_showNextPendingAchievement()` from AchievementLogic
- **Unified** all achievement display through NotificationLogic's `_showNextAchievementNotification()`
- **Ensured** single source of truth for queue management

### 2. Improved Timing & Animation
- **Optimized** auto-dismiss timer to 5 seconds (fallback safety)
- **Animation-based dismissal** - achievements auto-dismiss when animation completes (~2.1 seconds)
- **Extended** animation completion delay from 500ms→800ms (smoother transitions)
- **Removed** conflicting widget-level auto-dismiss timer
- **Added** proper animation state tracking

### 3. Enhanced Logging & Debugging
```dart
// Before: Minimal logging
print("🏆 Showing achievement: ${achievement.name}");

// After: Comprehensive queue tracking
print("📬 Queuing ${achievements.length} achievements for display");
print("🏆 Showing achievement: ${achievement.name} (${remaining} remaining in queue)");
print("🎬 Achievement animation complete, checking for next in queue...");
print("📋 Showing next achievement from queue (${remaining} remaining)");
print("📭 Achievement queue is now empty");
```

### 4. Proper State Management
- **Fixed** animation completion callbacks
- **Ensured** proper timer cancellation on manual dismissal
- **Coordinated** queue progression with animation states

## Key Changes Made

### `notification_logic.dart`
- Enhanced `queueAchievementsForDisplay()` with detailed logging
- Improved `_showNextAchievementNotification()` timing
- Set auto-dismiss to 5 seconds (fallback safety timer)
- Increased animation delay from 500ms→800ms

### `achievement_logic.dart`
- Removed conflicting `_showNextPendingAchievement()` method
- Updated `tryShowingNextAchievement()` to use unified system
- Improved `dismissCurrentAchievementNotification()` with timer cancellation
- Enhanced `notifyAchievementAnimationCompleted()` with queue progression

### `achievement_notification.dart`
- **Added** animation-based auto-dismiss (2.1 seconds - when animation completes)
- **Kept** animation completion callbacks for proper coordination
- **Maintained** user interaction (tap to dismiss) functionality

## Expected Behavior Now

1. **Multiple achievements earned** → All queued for display
2. **First achievement shows** → 2-second animation + auto-dismiss when complete
3. **Player can manually dismiss** → Timer cancelled, next shows immediately
4. **Animation completes** → Auto-dismiss triggers, 800ms delay, then next achievement
5. **Queue processes sequentially** → Each achievement gets ~2.1 seconds display time
6. **Detailed logging** → Clear visibility into queue state and progression

## Testing Scenario

When earning multiple achievements simultaneously (like "Investor" + "Stock Market Savvy"):

**Before Fix:**
```
🏆 Showing achievement: Investor
✅ Dismissed achievement notification: Investor
🔔 Displaying achievement: Stock Market Savvy  ← CONFLICT!
⏱️ Auto-dismissing achievement: Stock Market Savvy  ← INSTANT DISMISS!
```

**After Fix:**
```
📬 Queuing 2 achievements for display
🏆 Showing achievement: Investor (1 remaining in queue)
🎬 Achievement animation completed, auto-dismissing for consistency
✅ Dismissed achievement notification: Investor
🎬 Achievement animation complete, checking for next in queue...
📋 Showing next achievement from queue (1 remaining)
🏆 Showing achievement: Stock Market Savvy (0 remaining in queue)
🎬 Achievement animation completed, auto-dismissing for consistency
✅ Dismissed achievement notification: Stock Market Savvy
📭 Achievement queue is now empty
```

## Benefits

1. **Proper Achievement Experience** - Each achievement gets full display time
2. **Smooth Animations** - No conflicts or instant dismissals  
3. **Better UX** - Players can appreciate their progress
4. **Maintainable Code** - Single queue system, no conflicts
5. **Debug Visibility** - Clear logging for troubleshooting
6. **Scalable** - Handles any number of simultaneous achievements
