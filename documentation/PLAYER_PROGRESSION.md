## Replayability & Long-term Engagement

The current progression system encourages long-term engagement through:

2. **Multiple Pathways**: Different strategies for financial growth
3. **Idle Mechanics**: Progress even when not actively playing
4. **Risk/Reward**: Strategic decision making for optimal growth

## Platinum Points & Vault System

Platinum Points (PP) are a premium progression currency earned through achievements, challenges, and special milestones. The Platinum Vault allows players to redeem PP for:
- **Permanent Upgrades**: Enhance income, reduce event penalties, boost tap value, and more
- **Unlockables**: New businesses, investments, properties, and exclusive locales
- **Cosmetics**: Visual enhancements for businesses, avatars, and empire HQ
- **Boosters**: Temporary multipliers, instant cash, or event immunity (with cooldowns/limits)

Strategic use of the Vault is critical for late-game efficiency, event mitigation, and maximizing empire growth. Many upgrades are one-time, while some (e.g., Platinum Foundation, Facade) can be applied multiple times or to different assets.

## Event System & Negative Events

Events are a persistent part of gameplay, introducing risk and requiring active management:
- **Types**: Disasters, economic downturns, staff crises, security breaches, utility failures
- **Triggers**: Random, but more frequent as the empire grows
- **Impact**: Temporary penalties to income or assets, with stacking possible
- **Resolution**: Tap challenges, fee payments, ad-watching, or platinum-based immunity
- **Mitigation**: Platinum Resilience, boosters, and strategic upgrades reduce impact and frequency

Players must adapt strategies to frequent events, balancing growth with risk management.
