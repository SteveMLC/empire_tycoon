## Documentation Maintenance

These documents should be maintained and updated as the project evolves:

1. When implementing new features, add them to **Project Features**
2. When changing the technical implementation, update **Technical Architecture** and **Dependency Map**
3. When modifying progression mechanics, revise **Player Progression**
4. As features are completed, update the **Development Roadmap**
5. When deployment process changes, update **Server Architecture**
6. When testing processes evolve, update **Testing & QA**

## Additional Resources

The documentation should be read alongside the source code, particularly:

- `lib/models/game_state.dart` - Core game state and mechanics
- `lib/services/game_service.dart` - Game service and business logic
- `lib/screens/` - UI implementation and player interactions
- `server.js` - Server configuration and deployment setup
- `README.md` - Project overview and setup instructions

## Next Steps

1. Review all documentation for accuracy and completeness
2. Share documentation with relevant team members
3. Prioritize items from the Development Roadmap for upcoming sprints
4. Update documentation as the project evolves
5. Implement automated documentation generation where possible
