# Empire Tycoon - Technical Architecture

## Application Architecture

Empire Tycoon is a highly sophisticated, modular, cross-platform Flutter game following an advanced Model-View-Service architecture with 35,000+ lines of code. The codebase is organized for maximum scalability, maintainability, and extensibility, with comprehensive premium features and a robust platinum points ecosystem.

### Component Structure

1. **Models**: Advanced data structures for all game entities (businesses, investments, real estate, events, achievements, challenges)
2. **GameState (Highly Modularized)**: Central state management split into 16 specialized part files totaling over 8,000 lines
3. **Views/Screens**: 11 major UI containers with sophisticated layouts and interactions
4. **Widgets**: 40+ highly reusable UI components including premium/platinum-specific widgets
5. **Services**: Business logic orchestration with dedicated services for persistence, income calculation, and game management
6. **Data Layer**: Static configuration files for all game content (businesses, investments, properties, achievements, vault items)
7. **Utils**: Comprehensive helpers for formatting, time management, sound, and calculations
8. **Painters/Themes**: Custom painters and theming for premium visual effects

### Dependency/Data Flow

```
User Interaction → Screens/Widgets → Services → GameState (16 part files) → Persistence Layer
                                         ↓
                    Reactive UI Updates ← Provider/ChangeNotifier ← State Changes
```

- State changes propagate via Provider (`ChangeNotifier`) with optimized, targeted UI updates
- All persistent data uses robust JSON serialization with error handling and migration support
- Services layer provides business logic separation and dependency injection
