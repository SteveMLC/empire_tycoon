# AdMob app-ads.txt Setup Guide

## üö® **URGENT: Required for AdMob Compliance**

Starting January 2025, all AdMob apps **MUST** have app-ads.txt verification to prevent limited ad serving and revenue loss.

## üìÑ **Your app-ads.txt File**

The `app-ads.txt` file has been created in your project root with the correct content:

```
google.com, pub-1738655803893663, DIRECT, f08c47fec0942fa0
```

## üåê **Step 1: Get Your Developer Website Domain**

You need to identify the **exact domain** listed in your Google Play Store app listing:

1. Go to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console)
2. Find your "Empire Tycoon" app
3. Look for the **Developer Website** field in your app listing
4. Note the exact domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)

## üìã **Step 2: Upload app-ads.txt to Your Website**

### Option A: If You Have a Website
Upload the `app-ads.txt` file to the **root directory** of your website:

**‚úÖ Correct Location:**
```
https://yourdomain.com/app-ads.txt
```

**‚ùå Incorrect Locations:**
```
https://yourdomain.com/ads/app-ads.txt          ‚ùå Not in root
https://www.yourdomain.com/app-ads.txt          ‚ùå Wrong subdomain
https://yourdomain.com/empire-tycoon/app-ads.txt ‚ùå In subfolder
```

### Option B: If You Don't Have a Website

You need to create one! Here are quick options:

**Free Options:**
- **GitHub Pages** (Recommended for developers)
- **Netlify** 
- **Firebase Hosting**
- **Google Sites**

**Quick GitHub Pages Setup:**
1. Create GitHub repository named `yourusername.github.io`
2. Upload the `app-ads.txt` file to root
3. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
4. Your domain will be: `https://yourusername.github.io`

## üîó **Step 3: Update Google Play Store Listing**

1. Go to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console)
2. Select your "Empire Tycoon" app
3. Go to **Store presence** > **Store listing**
4. Add/Update the **Website** field with your domain
5. **Save changes**

**Important:** Use the exact domain format:
- ‚úÖ `https://yourdomain.com` 
- ‚úÖ `http://yourdomain.com`
- ‚ùå `www.yourdomain.com` (if your actual domain doesn't use www)

## ‚úÖ **Step 4: Verify Setup**

### Manual Check:
Visit your app-ads.txt URL in a browser:
```
https://yourdomain.com/app-ads.txt
```

You should see:
```
google.com, pub-1738655803893663, DIRECT, f08c47fec0942fa0
```

### AdMob Verification:
1. Go to [AdMob Console](https://admob.google.com)
2. Navigate to **Apps** > **View all apps**
3. Find your "Empire Tycoon" app
4. Check the **app-ads.txt status**
5. If needed, click **Crawl** to trigger verification

## ‚è∞ **Timeline & Important Notes**

### Processing Time:
- **Google Play Store**: Up to 24 hours to detect website changes
