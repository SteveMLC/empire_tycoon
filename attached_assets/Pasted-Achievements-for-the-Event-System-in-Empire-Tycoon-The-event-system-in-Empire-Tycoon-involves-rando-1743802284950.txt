Track the number of events resolved per business, per locale, and overall.

Use timestamps to monitor resolution speed for achievements like "Quick Fixer."

Tag events as "natural disaster" (e.g., typhoon, earthquake) for achievements like "Disaster Master."

Categorize locales as "tropical," "urban," or "rural" for regional achievements.
UI Integration:
