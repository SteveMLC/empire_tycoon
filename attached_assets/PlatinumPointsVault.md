]

Affect Application:
Upgrades: Apply multipliers (e.g., business.upgrade_modifier *= 1.05 for platinum_efficiency).

Unlockables: Add entities (e.g., properties.add({...}) for platinum_tower).

Events & Challenges: Modify event queue or start timers (e.g., events.filter(...) for platinum_shield, start_challenge(...) for platinum_challenge).

Cosmetics: Update visuals (e.g., player.avatar = platinum_mogul).

Boosters: Apply timed effects or add resources (e.g., income.global *= 2 for platinum_surge, player.cash += scaled_cash() for platinum_cache).

Example for platinum_cache

function apply_effect(effect):
  if effect.type == "add_resources":
    cash = scale_cash(player.progress) // $100K early, $10M late
    player.cash += cash
    

Limits: Track weekly resets (e.g., reset_purchases(weekly, game_time)), enforce max (e.g., purchases[platinum_surge] <= 3).

Frontend:
Render Items: <Card icon="{item.icon}" name="{item.name}" cost="{item.cost} PP">.

Update UI: Reflect purchases (e.g., if owned, button.label = "Owned"), show tooltips (e.g., <Tooltip>{item.description}</Tooltip>).

Assets: Create 64x64px icons (e.g., platinum_tower.png: skyscraper, platinum_yacht.png: yacht, platinum_islands.png: tropical island).

Testing:
Verify Costs: Buy platinum_cache (15 PP), check PP deduction (player.platinum_points -= 15).

Check Effects: Buy platinum_surge, confirm income doubles for 1h; buy platinum_tower, verify property added.

Test Limits: Buy platinum_surge 4x in a week, ensure 4th fails; buy platinum_efficiency twice, ensure second fails.

Edge Cases: Test with 0 PP, locked requirements (e.g., platinum_islands without Billionaire), scaled cash for platinum_cache.

Analytics: Log purchases (event: buy_item, item_id, pp_spent), track popularity (e.g., aggregate purchases by item_id).

Notes for Development
Priorities:
Start with Boosters (platinum_cache, platinum_surge, platinum_warp) for quick wins (simple effects, low cost).

Add Upgrades (platinum_efficiency, platinum_portfolio) next for core system boosts.

Implement Unlockables (platinum_tower, platinum_islands) last, as they require new content (properties, locations).

Assets:
Icons: 20 unique 64x64px PNGs (e.g., platinum_mogul.png: suit, platinum_venture.png: rocket).

Reuse: Leverage existing assets (e.g., Icons.diamond for PP visuals).

Balance:
Monitor: If platinum_cache (15 PP) is overbought, consider raising to 20 PP.

Adjust: If platinum_islands (500 PP) feels unreachable, lower to 400 PP post-playtest.

Integration:
Ensure effects hook into existing systems (e.g., businesses, locations, events).

Test with PP earn rates (e.g., ~50 PP early, ~500 PP mid-game) to confirm affordability.

This template provides a clear, actionable list of the Platinum Vault items for your team to implement. If you need specific code snippets (e.g., Unity C# for effects), icon design specs, or a phased rollout (e.g., 5 items first), let me know! Ready to proceed with implementation or tweaks?
