Release name
– This is just for you and your team to identify the build in the console (users won’t see it).
– Best practice: tie it to your version-numbering scheme. e.g.
• “1.0.0-Internal-Test”
• “v1.0.0 (100) – IT1”
– Keep it under 50 characters and consistent across all your tracks (internal, closed, open, production).
Release notes
– This is what your testers will see as “What’s new in this internal build.”
– Always include at least:
• Major new features or screens they should exercise
• Bug-fixes or known issues you want them to verify or watch out for
• Any special steps for them to follow (e.g. “Log in with test@test.com / password123”)
– Format as bullet-points, and wrap them in the appropriate language tags:
Apply to key.properti...
– If you support other languages, repeat your notes under each locale tag.
Once you complete this page, hitting “Next” will let you select the AAB you just built and choose your tester list.

Beyond this internal-testing release page, when you come to your very first Production release, here are some additional things you’ll want to have ready (and follow these best practices):
• App bundle & versioning
– Make sure your versionCode and versionName in pubspec.yaml match what you’re uploading.
– Stick to semantic versioning (e.g. 1.0.0+100).
• Store listing
– App title (up to 30 chars), short description (80 chars), long description (4,000 chars).
– High-quality screenshots for all target form-factors (phone, 7″ tablet, 10″ tablet).
– A feature graphic (1024×500), optional promo video, app icon (512×512), and hi-res icon (1024×1024).
– Localize store text for each market you support (English, Spanish, etc.).
• Categorization & details
– Choose the correct application category and type (Game → Simulation / Casual / Strategy).
– Provide a privacy-policy URL (required if you handle user data).
– Fill in the contact email, website, and phone (optional).
• Content rating & compliance
– Complete the rating questionnaire so Google can assign the correct age rating.
– Declare if you have ads, in-app purchases, sensitive permissions, or target child-directed audiences.
• Pricing & distribution
– Set your app to Free or Paid and pick the countries/regions where you want it available.
– Enable devices and form-factors (phone, tablet, Android TV, Wear OS, etc.).
• Release management
– Roll out incrementally (e.g. 5% of users) to catch any last-minute crashes.
– Monitor crash reports & user feedback; follow up with patch releases.
• Release notes (for users)
– When you get to the Production “What’s new” section, mirror your internal-test notes in plain text, focusing on new features and fixes.
By following those steps—and keeping your metadata, assets, and release notes well-organized—you’ll breeze through your very first Google Play release. Good luck, and congratulations on shipping Empire Tycoon!
