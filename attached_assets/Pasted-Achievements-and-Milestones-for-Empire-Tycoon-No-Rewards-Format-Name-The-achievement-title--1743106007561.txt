Developer Notes
Implementation:  
Store achievements in a JSON structure: {name, description, category, completed: false}.  

Track via player stats (e.g., properties owned, total cash flow, locale completion).  

Display in an “Achievements” tab with progress tracking (e.g., “47/50 properties” for Portfolio Builder).
Balancing:  
Progress achievements scale from beginner (1 property) to expert (200 properties).  

Wealth milestones reflect exponential financial growth, aligning with property costs ($500 to $75M).  

Regional achievements encourage exploration of all 20 locales.
Visuals (Optional):  
Add icons or badges later (e.g., acacia leaf for Rural Kenya, Statue of Liberty for NYC) in the same flat/cartoonish style as properties.
