Implementation Details
Timing Mechanism:
Use real-time timers to track event triggers and enforce frequency constraints.

Store timestamps of recent events to ensure no more than 2 events per hour and a 15-minute gap between events.
Event Notification:
Display a pop-up when an event occurs (e.g., "Oh no! Your Craft Brewery is shut down due to contamination! Income reduced to -25%. Resolve by: [options]").
Visual Indicators:
Mark affected businesses or properties with a red icon on the game map.
Income Adjustment:
Calculate normal income for the affected business or properties.

Set income to -25% of normal (e.g., newIncome = normalIncome * -0.25).
Dynamic Calculations:
Business Fee: Sum the costs of all levels up to the current level and multiply by 0.5.

Locale Fee: Sum the purchase prices of the top 50% of properties (by value) and multiply by 0.5.
Ad Integration:
Implement an ad API for immediate resolution.
Challenge UI:
Create a tap counter with a progress bar for the 200-tap challenge.
Testing:
Ensure the negative income mechanic doesn’t overly penalize early-game players; adjust the -25% rate if needed based on playtesting.
Examples
Business Event Example
Event: "Craft Brewery has been shut down due to food contamination."

Normal Income: 1200/sec (at Level 1).

Penalty: Income reduced to -25% of normal = -300/sec.

Resolution Options:
Wait 1 hour.

Watch an ad.

Pay 50% of total upgrade costs (e.g., Level 1 cost = 500,000; Fee = 250,000).

Tap 200 times.
Locale Event Example
Event: "Singapore earthquake has caused severe damage."

Affected: Top 50% of properties in Singapore by value (10 out of 20 properties).

Normal Income: Assume 10 properties generate 10,000/sec total.

Penalty: Income reduced to -25% of normal = -2,500/sec.

Resolution Options:
Wait 1 hour.

Watch an ad.

Pay 50% of the sum of affected properties' purchase prices (requires property data).

Tap 200 times.
This Event_system.md provides a detailed blueprint for implementing the interactive event system in Empire Tycoon, with the updated penalty mechanic of reducing income to -25% of normal. Ensure property data is integrated for accurate fee calculations, and adjust the negative income rate or tap count based on playtesting to maintain game balance.
