Below is a revised version of the Global Real Estate Investment system for Empire Tycoon, where each of the 10 housing options per locale is now an individual, standalone property type that players can purchase separately, rather than upgrades. This maintains the progression from affordable to premium properties within each locale, reflecting regional affordability and uniqueness. Costs and cash flow are adjusted slightly to ensure balance as standalone investments, while keeping the system complementary to businesses.
Framework Recap for Global Real Estate
Core Concept: Players can buy unique real estate properties in 20 global locales, each with 10 distinct property types. Costs and income scale with regional economics (e.g., Rural Kenya is cheapest, Hong Kong is priciest).  

Mechanics:  
Purchase Price: Cost to buy each property type.  

Cash Flow: Passive income per second, increasing with costlier properties.  

Progression: 10 property types per locale, from basic to luxury, with no upgrades—each is a separate purchase.  

Unlocks: Real estate unlocks after the first business ($250), with the cheapest property at $500.
Developer Notes:  
UI: “Real Estate” tab with a world map; each locale lists 10 buyable properties.  

Economy: Cash flow is slightly lower than businesses to keep them secondary early on.  

Players can own multiple properties per locale (e.g., buy all 10 in Rural Kenya).

Developer Implementation Notes
Economy Balance:  
Cheapest property: $500 (Rural Kenya Mud Hut) aligns with post-hustle income ($250 business → $500 property).  

Cash flow scales roughly with cost (e.g., $1,000 = $1/sec, $1M = $1,000/sec), slightly below businesses to keep them secondary early-game.  

Late-game properties (e.g., Hong Kong’s Victoria Peak Estate at $75M/$75k/sec) complement high-end businesses ($50M+).
Data Structure:  
Locale object: {name, properties[]}.  

Property object: {name, purchasePrice, cashFlowPerSec}.  

Store all 10 properties per locale in a static table.
UI Flow:  
World map with 20 pins (color-coded by cost: green for cheap, red for expensive).  

Each locale lists 10 properties with “Buy” buttons, showing cost and cash flow. Players can own multiple properties (e.g., all 10 in one locale).
Visuals:  
Unique icons per property (e.g., mud hut for Rural Kenya, glass tower for Dubai).  

No upgrade visuals needed—each property is a standalone asset.
This revised system offers 200 unique real estate options across 20 locales, each buyable as a standalone investment. It keeps the global flavor and regional affordability intact, giving players flexibility to diversify their portfolio. Let me know if you need further refinements!
